![Sukant looking good :p](/media/about-photo.jpg)

A software engineer who is usually worried writing better code. Starting my career with Data Science, I eventually realized that building applications is more fun (at least for me). Python and Javascript are my lingo, and Golang probably in some time. I like to do both backend and frontend, although I find its very hard to be good at both. Till now, I have spent more time on backend development. I'm currently working on a side project on journal app. If you have any interesting ideaa and would like to colloborate, feel free to reach out at [sukant7337@gmail.com](mailto:sukant7337@gmail.com).   

I'm looking for new opportunities and if you find my experience relevant, please drop me a mail. 

On personal side, I am a minimalist and this principle defines my life choices a lot (Don't judge me by the above photo, that was just one occasion and nothing bad in having one good suit :p).
